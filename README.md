# Github PR Checker

This project was created for anyone who can't review PR's in time.

# What is our goal?

With this work, I intend to allow anyone to connect in Github and verify from each repository, all the pull requests remaining to review in order to improve team reviews and make life easier for programmers when it comes to checking which PR's are missing revision.
